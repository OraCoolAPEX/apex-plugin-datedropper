### Component-Level Custom Attributes

* Default Date: This option offers the possibility to set a starting date. Please note that you must follow this specific format (mm-dd-yyyy) to allow the matching to recognize month, day and year (`Default: CURRENT DATE`).
* Disabled Days: This option offers the possibility to set a string of disabled days. So, separete all days by comma and the picker will convert them into an array. Please note that you must follow this specific format (mm/dd/yyyy) to allow the matching to recognize month, day and year (`Default: false`).
* Init Set: This option changes the input value automatically, by default. Set to false to prevent it (`Default: true`).
* Large Mode: This option enables to switch the size of the picker by clicking on the icon at the bottom or clicking on the day block (`Default: false`).
* Large Default: If set to true, this option shows the large view by default (`Default: false`).
* Lock: This option sets the date limit based on the assigned variable. If you set to "from", you can't select a date earlier than the current date. Opposed to this behavior, if it's set to "to", you can not select a date after the current date (`Default: false`).
* Jump: It groups years based on the value set(multiple). This option is enabled when you click on the year block, to accellerate the transition between years (`Default: 10`).
* Max Year: The highest year that the control will allow (`Default: CURRENT YEAR`).
* Min Year: The lowest year that the control will allow (`Default: 1970`).
* Modal: If this option is set to true, the picker will be displayed centered, with a dark overlay in background (`Default: false`).

### Application-Level Custom Attributes

* Format: The date format the picker will write on the selected input (`Default: "m-d-Y"`).
